# my-snippets-library

This is my snippets library repo that is built on MKDOCs.  

It's a simple site that sits on Github Pages and uses a github action to deploy after each push to main.

The contents of the site is just snippets of commands that I find are extremely handy throughout my IT/Cloud career.

## Browsing
Browsing the site is fairly easy with the table of contents on the right hand side for any given file you are in.

The left hand tree is also easily accessible to browse to the required topic.

## Searching

Searching is as easy as hitting 's' or typing in the top search bar
