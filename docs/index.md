# My Snippets Library

Welcome! This is my personal collection of code snippets for commands that are either handy to have or I always forget and have to quickly search for.

### Quick Access
* **[Azure CLI](azcli.md)** – Authentication, Subscriptions, and Resource management.
* **[Git & Version Control](git.md)** – Branching, merging, and all the rest
* **[OpenSSL](openssl.md)** – Certificate inspection and conversion.
* **[Terraform](terraform/index.md)** – My full library of IaC snippets.
* **[Kubernetes](kubernetes/index.md)** – My full library of Kubernetes snippets.

### How to use
Press **`S`** or click the search bar at the top to search globally. Most snippets have a **Copy** button in the top right corner.
